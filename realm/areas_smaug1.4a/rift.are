Blueskinned creatures with knotted, muscular limbs and flowing white
beards, frost giants are totally acclimatized to the freezing cold of
the rift, though they are in turn susceptible to more than a mild 
increase in temperature. Burly, mean-spirited and cruel, they favor
combat and pillaging to talking and creating, and this is evident in
all aspects of their warlike culture.

a winter wolf~
A huge wolf, its fur tinged with frost, stalks through the ice cavern.
~
Faithful pets of the frost giants, these wolves serve as both hunting
and guard beasts, and are intelligent enough to understand a series of
spoken commands. Their fur exudes a chill that causes discomfort to 
their foes, while their icy breath can smite a lesser foe.

Like all the giantish races, the frost giants supplant their relatively
small numbers with large volumes of troops of other races, most notably
ogres, trolls and gnolls. These mercenaries serve well as long as they
are paid and fed, and the odds are stacked in their favor. They are not
as powerful as giants, but are still very tough and strong.

and organized, they are nevertheless thoroughly evil and bent on the
conquest of others. This envoy has been sent to liase with the Jarl on the
behalf of King Snurre, and it hating every second of it.

Jarl), and won't give up his cushy life easily.

Like all the giantish races, the frost giants supplant their relatively
small numbers with large volumes of troops of other races, most notably
ogres, trolls and gnolls. These mercenaries serve well as long as they
are paid and fed, and the odds are stacked in their favor. They are not
as powerful as giants, but are still very tough and strong.

Grugnur~
The frost giant Jarl sits here, scowling, upon his throne.
~
Grugnur is a frost giant, as large as a cloud giant, and as strong as
one too. He is ugly; all giants are ugly by the standards of your race
but he is of particularly foul visage, and mein. He holds all other 
races in contempt, save for those who sponser his raids on humanity.

A Windswept Ledge~
The moment you materialize on this ledge you are almost swept off it
by a strong gust of icy wind, that almost sends you hurtling down the
sheer slope of the mountain that this tiny section of level stone is
set into. A yawning abyss beckons there, you cannot even see to the
bottom through the blizzard that is raging through the region. Other
snow-covered spires loom all around, while gale force winds buffet you
mercilessly. The wind howls and shrieks as it blows through the gaps
between the peaks; the effect is quite disturbing. The only apparent
escape from this torment is a small hole in the ground, that leads on
down into the darkness within the mountain.

A tunnel descends steeply from the ledge, heading down to whatever is
within the bowels of the peak you arrived on. No torches light the
area, at least not here, though a dim light is visible far, far below.
Snow drifts formed by snow that has come in the hole above pile high to
either side, and are marked with the tracks of various creatures, some
of whom are rather large; giantish in fact. The howling wind above is
nerve wracking, and it takes little incentive to proceed downwards to
where it is quieter.

gone is the steep descent you have up till now endured. A dim glow can 
be seen to the southeast, where the majority of the tracks seem to pass
to and from. The walls are of crevice-ridden granite, covered with thin
layers of ice and frost, frozen by the chilly temperatures here, though
they are at least bearable with adequate clothing, unlike outside.

The Rift~
After roughly one hundred yards, the path emerges onto another ledge,
though this one is inside instead of outside. To your surprise, it
runs for a short distance along the eastern edge of a truly massive
rift, which yawns to the west, stretching into the distance to the far
south. Gusts of wind whistle up and down the rift, the floor of which
is not visible from this vantage. The ledge continues to the south,
disappearing around a bend to the southwest, as it circles the rift.
An opening in the wall just south of here offers an alternate route,
however, and it is to here that most of the tracks run.

faint greenish glow provides a little light here and there, though the
conditions are still gloomy, to your eyes at least.

ice, which has been worn away in portions due to contact with the bodies
of passing creatures, who where apparently of considerable stature. The
faint greenish glow is still present, illuminating fresh tracks in the

Several piles of sleeping skins cover the floor of this cave, which
is for the most part covered in layers of ice, save for where the
sleeping area is. Piles of boulders and blocks of ice lay near the
entrance, presumably to serve as primitive missile weapons for the
monsters that lair here, who are undoubtedly sentient, and more than
likely of malevolent mein. No other exit umbrages the icy walls; the
cave is isolated from the rest of the complex save for the opening
to the north.

This natural cavern was hollowed out by centuries of erosion from the
movement of ice through the bowels of the mountain, and as such could
escape notice as being the residence of giants, save for the four fur
covered mounds that serve as their beds. Large icy stalactites depend
from the high roof; excessive heat or noise could bring them tumbling
down, so caution would be advised. A broad passage, leading further

This broad passage runs east for a short distance, before turning to

running parallel to the rift to the west, beyond the guard rooms. It

small patches of snow, while several of the icy protrusions have also
been snapped off as clumsy giants stumble into them, especially when

see under the current lighting conditions. The air is cold, though 
not unbearably so, and the walls covered with ice, some of which has
melted and formed dangerous semi-frozen puddles on the floor in the
numerous potholes that mar the tunnel. A larger creature, such as a
giant or troll, may well stumble and fall upon these hazards, though
the injury would do more damage to their pride than their rears.

An Icy Passage~
Onwards and downwards the passage runs, continuing deeper into this
haven of giants. The footprints are just as frequent, and just as
fresh; it appears dozens of giants have been on the move recently.
This is no surprise; you are here because of their 'movements' that
have taken them into conflict with the peaceful races of the south.
The frost giants are a violent and bloodthirsty lot, far tougher and
braver than their brutish hill giant cousins.

At this point the passage begins to bend to the southwest, changing its
course for the first time in several hundred yards. An opening in the
west wall is the first side passage the tunnel has boasted for nearly
its entire length, though judging by the tracks it is not a popular
section of the rift. Your sense of direction tells you that heading 
around the bend to the west will take you back out towards the ledges
that line the rift, though there appears to be little choice but to
return and skirt that ominous feature.

The ledge hugs the rift wall here, allowing scant purchase for anyone
to travel; at times you have to hug the wall as well, grabbing what
handholds you can to avoid being swept off the icy ledge, which affords
precious little purchase, by the winds that gust through the rift. A
lone wolf howls somewhere in the distance; a warning, perhaps, or a cry

cave entrance to the east, within which lies the gods-know-what... 
it is far too dark to see far, despite the greenish glow given off
at sporadic intervals by the unusual lithic anomalies that are so
common in this subterranean rift. Tracks in the thin layer of snow
that carpets the rubble appear to be canine, or more accurately,
lupine in origin.

This gloomy cavern does not contain the luminescent stone found in 
other sections of the caves, and thus it is quite difficult to see
and navigate. Large chunks of ice litter the floor, having fallen 
from the roof above; apparently the ceiling of icicles is extremely 
unstable. Dark openings beckon to the east and south; the wolf tracks

This small cave is devoid of rubble; instead it boasts piles of frozen

in bite marks. Whatever beast tore these people apart, it must have a
set of powerful jaws. An awful smell, of wet canine, permeates all of
this cave, insulting your nostrils with its stench.

Several hacked and mutilated bodies have been frozen upright into the
icy walls of this chamber, to intimidate intruders, as these are the
remains of previous trespassers, displaying the fate they met. Many 
of them still appear to be wearing their equipment; perhaps some of
it is still in reasonable condition. The corpses are of elves, dwarves
and humans, doubtless previous adventurers who sought to put down the
leadership that has inspired the giants to war against humanity. Most of
them were slain by blows to the head, then savaged by wolves, or perhaps
even trolls. Frozen blood still carpets most of their forms, which stand
with mouths agape, captured in the shock of death.

An Icy Ledge~
The tunnel opens onto another icy ledge, this one marginally wider
than the one near the entrance to the north, which is dimly visible
from here, bending sharply away to the northeast some 300 feet away,
in between lying one of the deep gorges opening into the rift, which
runs north and south parallel to the ledge as far as you can see. A
fierce wind whistles eerily through the rift, chilling you even in
your warm clothing. The floor of the rift is some 200 feet below, a
fall that would kill the stoutest of men; flying down is also out of
the question as the fierce winds would smash you against the rift wall.

Several passages branch off into the icy depths of the caverns that
surround the glacial rift, most of them heading to the south, and 
thus deeper into the complex maze of passages. It is south that you
must go, for it is there that you will surely encounter the Jarl, but
the possibility of gathering loot from those along the way should not
be ignored either. Numerous giants can be seen moving about in the
distance, though a careful adventurer shouldn't find them terribly hard
to avoid.

are a dull grey, visible through the thin translucent layer of frost
that coats them. This cavern is the quarters for some of the many non-

The bedding here is little better than that to the north, and the same

smell, of unwashed ogre combined with excrement and stale food, is
noticeable from even a dozen yards away. How a creature could live like
this is beyond you, though the chill does mean that the spoiled food and
waste is usually frozen before disease afflicts the occupants, who seem

This corridor is knee-deep in snow, that has blown in from the west,
where it opens onto an icy ledge that overlooks the blizzard-ridden
glacial rift. No tracks mar the white powder, as it slowly turns to
slush; it would appear the giants have no need, or desire, to travel
down this section of their lair. It is cold here, colder even than

center of the rift. Snow is whipped into your face by winds of terrific
speed, which threaten to send you sailing off the icy ledge to the icy
ground far, far below. Even if the fall didn't kill you, the howling
wind would most likely dash you against the rocks long before you did
in fact impact with the ground.

As you pass into the cave, you are engulfed in mist, and find it hard

the interior, you are surprised to suddenly find the floor disappear
beneath your feet! The hidden heat source has melted the icy floor of
the cave, exposing a gaping hole that plummets many scores of yards
downwards through the center of the mountain, and it is down this hole
you plummet; even a fly spell couldn't save you as strong currents of
wind grab ahold of you and dash you against jagged protrusions as you
fall. You are dead long before your battered form is impaled on the 
sharp icicles that line the bottom of this gorge, where it will remain,
undiscovered for, most likely, all eternity.

dire warning against proceeding south down the narrow passage that is
visible here. A dim glow reveals the tunnel is low-ceilinged, and the
roof is lined with large chunks of ice which fall off as you watch at

blizzard that fills the center of the rift, and thus you find it quite
difficult to maintain your position on the icy ground. Flight more than

The Icy Ledge~
The wind ravages this section of the ledge, as it passes closest to
the raging storm visible from here as a whirling maelstrom of snow
and debris, battering all within its considerable reach. Scuff marks
near the edge of the ledge show where previous victims have plummeted
to their deaths, though giants are strong enough to resist such a fate.
A cave of said beasts lies to the southwest; guests of the Jarl, here on

The Hill Giant Embassy~
This cave quarters the representatives of the hill giants, who keep
the Jarl informed of the progress of their people, and keep Nosnra 
equally informed of the Jarl's plans, as ordained by Snurre of the
fire giants, the leaders of the alliance. However, this has changed
recently with the destruction of the Steading at the hands of mighty
adventurers, and now the hill giants have the unenviable task here
of informing the Jarl of this occurence. The Jarl has a reputation 
for blaming the bearer of ill tidings, and these three know for sure
that their heads will soon decorate the Jarl's trophy room.

Although this section of ledge is still assaulted by driving snow and
gusts of wind, it is not as difficult to keep your footing, though
progress is slow. Another cave opening offers shelter from the storm,
though it is undoubtedly inhabited, as the Jarl keeps most of the many
visitors to the rift quartered here, to discourage random roamings. A
snarl from far below, in the rift, is the first indication that there
is life down there, undoubtedly of the unfriendly variety.

The ledge ends here, abruptly, at the souternmost end of the rift; the
wall south of here is also the southern wall of the rift. Bones lie
scattered about the ledge here, near a gaping hole in the wall, which
appears to be the home of some glacial horror; perhaps one not allied
with the giants, but undoubtedly still no friend of yours. The tunnel
is large enough to enter, though there is no point; the back wall is

This chamber houses several stone giants, whom the Jarl is trying to
woo into working for him; stone giants are revered by all other races
of giants for their immense strength, resistance to damage and most of
all their unparalleled ability to work stone and metal. Extraordinary
smiths, some even work in the employ of the Emperor; stone giants have
no real scruples as to the nature of their employer as long as the pay
is good and the hours reasonable.

an indication that perhaps you are approaching a lower level of the
rift. Traffic is heavy here, and harder to avoid as the tunnel is well
lit and the occupants alert. More voices echo on either side, from 
groups of giants heading to or from duty. Bloodstains mark the snow

despite the distance, snow drifts have still managed to form, piling in
the corners to chest height on a giant. Booted feet have trampled down
the snow nearest the center of the passage. The air is chill, more than

At this point in the corridor you are assaulted by a blast of heat,
totally unexpected in this icy domain. The tracks in the snow skirt
wide of its source- a large opening in the southeastern wall. A dim
reddish glow, like that of embers, is visible, and the heat has all
but melted the ice in the vicinity, leaving bare the rock underneath.

Plumes of flame leap forth from hidden openings in the rock, flickering

comes out with. The entire cavern is devoid of ice; instead it contains
some unusual (for a frost giant lair) furniture of obsidian- a table, a
chair and several benches, plus several braziers stacked with burning
coals. If the cold is so unpleasant for one of your race, you cannot

downward, towards a new level of the rift. The corridor is more even

creatures moving about on business of their own, most of them giants.

wolves, that roam the tunnels in search of magically concealed foes.

The icy layer is thinner here than earlier, and no longer forms the
bulk of the architecture. Thus it is safe for the giants to place some
torches here, set in cressets on the walls, to cast ample light to see
by, without fear of the tunnel collapsing. Howls and shrieks, from one
of several monsters rather than the wind for a change, echo all around

of smooth, though unworked, stone, which bear small tapestries and a
torch or three. The hard stony ground underfoot cannot betray signs of
passage, though the stone worn smooth along the walls by encounters 
with giantish shoulders show that some creatures do frequent this area.
Although there are no markings or indicators, you feel certain that you
are nearing the Jarl's own chambers, or at least his palace.

The passage exits into a high, open cavern, that stretches away in all
three directions. The starry sky is visible far, far above, over 300
yards away; the effect is quite enthralling. The cavern is eerily quiet
save for the sound of water dripping onto stone somewhere far away. A
grim sense of foreboding comes over you as you consider your options; 
there is a definite evil at work somewhere here, its source not obvious
immediately, but definitely present. Large boulders block two passages
to the east and west, movable only by a stout warrior, while the cavern
continues to the south.

The boulder opens onto a chamber of breathtaking beauty. Instead of
rocky, unhewn walls, this cavern is actually a chamber proper; the 
stone has been carefully worked into a series of doric columns, that
support a vaulted roof heavily decorated with art that appears elvish
in origin, though it is unlike any you have ever seen. Evidently this
place was fashioned by creatures centuries older than the giants, and
abandoned some time ago. The floor is of polished marble, its lustre
adding a glorious shine as your light reflects off of it and onto all
the jewelled statues that ring the hall. It continues to the northeast,
the floor raising slightly to match the terrain. A legion of dwarves
would take decades to match this marvel; even stone giants would be left
gasping in awe at the work that went into bending the natural stone to
the will of the master artisans.

The floor rises here, to a set of marble steps that, flanked by columns
carved to resemble vase-bearing maidens, rise to a ledge lined with many
statues of bronze, surprisingly free of corrosion, surrounding a dais,
upon which the Queen of this ancient race once reclined. A different kind
of queen now resides here, though she has similar vanities and taste in
furnishings. A jewelled box filled with priceless metals has been almost
casually crushed beneath the weight of an apparently worthless alabaster
statue that would require 6 people to shift. A priceless tapestry has
been sliced to ribbons to bind together a frail, and unappealing, wooden
carving of a giant. Whatever creatures are now masters of this domain,
they have curious values.

Jarl has poor taste in decor, if the tacky tapestries that line the
walls here are any indication; they are cheaply made, and of poor
quality and worksmanship. A long bronze horn, to be winded by the

This small cavern houses a single giant- a cloud giant from the far

been convinced that the Jarl has a very good chance of making a tidy
sum of money from his raids, and has signed on as a mercenary. Other
giants, not as easily impressed by the Jarl's speeches, have declined
an alliance, and returned home; many of the cloud giants have stayed
here, and subsequently left in disgust- not all cloud giants are evil.
A table laden with food and fine cutlery are just some of the cajolery

The Great Cavern of the Jarl~
The cavern narrows here, to a point to the southwest where a stone dais
holds the throne of the Jarl. Guttering torches cast ample light here,
though the long shadows they cast are disconcerting. Voices raised in
anger and excitement can be heard at random intervals from various parts
of the caverns.

The Seat of Power~
Here rests the Jarl's throne of bone and ivory; silvered skulls supported
by ivory tusks, bearing a seat made from mammoth rib cages. Two torches
flank the monstrous seat, casting long shadows with its bulk, obscuring
most of the steps that approach the dais, covered by bearskin rugs and
the hides of other, unidentifiable creatures. More hides decorate the walls
and ceiling, while a bear hide almost obscures a narrow passage that runs
east, presumably to the Jarl's private quarters.

A Short Passage~
The tunnel ends after a short distance before another boulder, these
rocks that serve as doors to this burly people. Scuff marks mark where
it has been shoved casually aside in the past by the mighty giant Jarl
on the way to or from his private quarters. A crude rune carved into
the rock, of dwarven and giantish origin, spells one word- KING.

A Macabre Trophy Chamber~
This spacious chamber is filled with all manner of trophies. The skins
and hides of a score of different creatures cover the walls and floor,
and even the ceiling. Shelves lined with skulls- human, giant, elven,
dwarven, ogre and even gnomish- are placed in front of the hides, while
a fireplace supports a row of mastodon tusks, flanked by the mighty
tusks of an Umber Hulk. The skins of the creatures range from mundane 
(boars, bears, snakes and birds) to the exotic (wyverns, dragons, sabre
tooth tigers and even a shedu). Arms and armor taken from foes from many
parts of the world are also present, each bearing the scars from blows of
the Jarl that were the end of their former owners. A lynx pelt hangs over
an exit in the eastern wall, where presumably the Jarl rests, while a hide
of a giant lizard flanked by a pair of eagle's wings hang above the exit
to the north.

Chamber of the Carls~
Those giants who are of higher status in the caverns reside here, near
the quarters of the Jarl himself. They have proper beds, not piles of
hides, and considerable amounts of furnishings, stolen from races they
have raided or conquered. Evidently those quartered here are also of
considerable means.

The Jarl's Private Chamber~
In comparison to the Jarl's grisly trophy lounge, this chamber is
strikingly bare. Only a few sparse decorative features are present;
the most notable is a large bear skin, a beloved pet of the Jarl and
his wife, that covers the floor. A large table littered with jacks
of ale and goblets of wine is ample evidence of the tastes these two
have for alcohol, and the fine foods from a dozen different cultures
is a result of the many raids made by the Jarl; he has developed a
taste for foreign cuisine. Several boxes and chests stuffed with a
range of worthless clothing and similar line the walls.
