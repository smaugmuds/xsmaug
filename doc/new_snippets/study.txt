1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included
comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but
do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site
without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.

3. ( optional ) Register with the forums at http://forums.alsherok.net
Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

This can be a somewhat powerful skill, as it allows anyone who can
use the skill to learn spells from any staff, wand, or scroll possessing
them. The newly learned spell will start off at 1%, and cannot be studied
further. However, it is probably possible to practice the skill at
a guildmaster once the player has it. It's not advised to give this 
skill to a multiclass character if your mud supports multiclassing. 
Recommended for higher level mages and clerics only.

Note: This code has not been in use on Alsherok for some time and may
conain bugs I am not aware of.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. In skills.c, add the following code:

/* Allows PCs to learn spells embedded in object. Should prove interesting. - Samson 8-9-98 */
void do_study( CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument ) /* study by Absalom */
{
    char arg[MAX_INPUT_LENGTH];
    OBJ_DATA *obj;
    int sn = 0;

    one_argument( argument, arg );

    if ( arg[0] == '\0' )
    {
	send_to_char( "Study what?\r\n", ch );
	return;
    }

    if ( ( obj = get_obj_carry( ch, arg ) ) == NULL )
    {
	send_to_char( "You do not have that item.\r\n", ch );
	return;
    }

    if ( obj->item_type != ITEM_STAFF && obj->item_type != ITEM_WAND &&
	obj->item_type != ITEM_SCROLL )
    {
	send_to_char( "You can only study scrolls, wands, and staves.\r\n", ch );
	return;
    }

    act( AT_MAGIC, "$n studies $p.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_ROOM );
    act( AT_MAGIC, "You study $p.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_CHAR );

    if (obj->item_type == ITEM_STAFF || obj->item_type == ITEM_WAND )
    {
	sn = obj->value[3];
	if ( sn < 0 || sn >= MAX_SKILL || skill_table[sn]->spell_fun == spell_null )
	{
	  bug( "Do_study: bad sn %d.", sn );
	  return;
	}
	WAIT_STATE( ch, skill_table[gsn_study]->beats );
	if ( number_percent() >= 55 + ch->pcdata->learned[gsn_study] * 4/5)
	{
	  send_to_char("You cannot glean any knowledge from it.\r\n",ch);
	  learn_from_failure( ch, gsn_study );
	  act( AT_FIRE, "$p burns brightly and is gone.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_CHAR );
	  separate_obj( obj );
	  extract_obj( obj );
	  return;
	}
	if ( ch->pcdata->learned[sn])
	{
	  send_to_char("You already know that spell!\r\n",ch);
	  return;
	}
	ch->pcdata->learned[sn] = 1;
	act( AT_MAGIC, "You have learned the art of $t!", ch ,skill_table[sn]->name, NULL, TO_CHAR);
	learn_from_success( ch, gsn_study );
	act( AT_FIRE, "$p burns brightly and is gone.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_CHAR );
      separate_obj( obj );
	extract_obj( obj );
	return;
    }

    if (obj->item_type == ITEM_SCROLL)
    {
	sn = obj->value[1];
	if ( sn < 0 || sn >= MAX_SKILL || skill_table[sn]->spell_fun == spell_null )
	{
	  bug( "Do_study: bad sn %d.", sn );
	  return;
	}
	if ( number_percent() >= 15 + ch->pcdata->learned[gsn_study] * 4/5)
	{
	  send_to_char("You cannot glean any knowledge from it.\r\n",ch);
	  learn_from_failure( ch, gsn_study );
	  act( AT_FIRE, "$p burns brightly and is gone.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_CHAR );
	  separate_obj( obj );	
	  extract_obj( obj );
	  return;
	}
	if ( ch->pcdata->learned[sn])
	{
	  send_to_char("You already know that spell!\r\n",ch);
	  return;
	}
	ch->pcdata->learned[sn] = 1;
	act( AT_MAGIC, "You have learned the art of $t!", ch, skill_table[sn]->name, NULL, TO_CHAR);
	learn_from_success( ch, gsn_study );
	act( AT_FIRE, "$p burns brightly and is gone.", ch, obj, NULL, TO_CHAR );
	separate_obj( obj );
	extract_obj( obj );
	return;
    }

}

2. In db.c, below the following:

      sh_int			gsn_slice;

   add the following on the next line:

short gsn_study;

   Below the following:

	ASSIGN_GSN( gsn_poison,		"poison" );

   add the following on the next line:

	ASSIGN_GSN( gsn_study,		"study" );

4. In mud.h, above the following:

extern	sh_int	gsn_dodge;

   insert the following:

extern short gsn_study; /* Samson */

   And in the proper section, add: DECLARE_DO_FUN( do_study );

5. In tables.c, add the appropriate entries for do_study.

6. Make clean, then recompile.

7. After the reboot, type: sset create skill study
   then type: slookup study, and record the SN number it gives you.
   Substitute that number for SN in the rest of this step.
   then type: sset SN type skill
   then type: sset SN guild -1
   then type: sset SN code do_study
   then type: sset save skill table

8. Edit your class files accordingly depending on what classes you
   want to have this new skill.
