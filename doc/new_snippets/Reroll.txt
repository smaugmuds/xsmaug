Terms of Use
------------

1. You may use this snippet in your code provided that any included
comment headers in the code are left intact. You may add your own, but
do not take mine out.

2. This snippet may not be posted for redistribution on any site
without obtaining prior written consent from the Alsherok team.

3. ( optional ) Register with the forums at http://forums.alsherok.net
Registration is not required to make use of the snippet, but since I no
longer provide email support for any of the code I release, forum posts
are your only avenue for direct support. This may seem overly stupid,
but you can blame the continuing abuse I suffer from spammers for this.
Don't post stuff to TMC or TMS asking about my code. I'm highly unlikely
to ever notice it there on the rare ocassions I skim posts in either place.

If forum registration doesn't appeal to you, then you can try to get ahold
of me via IMC on the code channel.

If you can't agree to these terms, don't use this code, and don't expect
me to help if something breaks while installing it. Harsh? Hardly. I'm
tired of people who come crawling to whine and complain when they haven't
bothered to comply with the terms first.

What this code does
-------------------

New characters will be able to reroll for their stats at creation.
Note that in stock Smaug code, name_stamp_stats picks the player's
stats based on their name. The reroll code will call to name_stamp
weather it's altered or not, but with stock code, the roll won't
change much if at all. A replacement for name_stamp_stats is included.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. In comm.c, add the following constate code to function nanny,
   somewhere below an existing constate:

    case CON_ROLL_STATS:
      switch (argument[0] )
      {
         case 'y': case 'Y':
	     write_to_buffer( d, "\r\nWould you like ANSI, or no graphic/color support, (A/N)? ", 0 );
	     d->connected = CON_GET_WANT_RIPANSI;
         break;

         case 'n': case 'N':
     
	   name_stamp_stats(ch);

         snprintf( buf, MAX_STRING_LENGTH, "\r\nStr: %d  Int: %d  Wis: %d  Dex: %d  Con: %d  Cha: %d  Lck: %d\r\nKeep? (Y/N)",
         ch->perm_str, ch->perm_int, ch->perm_wis, ch->perm_dex, ch->perm_con, 
	   ch->perm_cha, ch->perm_lck );
	   write_to_buffer( d, buf, 0 );
         return;
         default: write_to_buffer( d, "Yes or No? ", 0 );
         return;
       }
    break;

2. Also in comm.c, after the following in CON_GET_NEW_RACE:
    
    if ( iRace == MAX_RACE
    ||  !race_table[iRace].race_name || race_table[iRace].race_name[0] == '\0'
    ||   IS_SET(race_table[iRace].class_restriction, 1 << ch->class) )
	{
	    write_to_buffer( d,
		"That's not a race.\r\nWhat IS your race? ", 0 );
	    return;
	}

Replace the remaining code from there to the break; with this:

      /* Rerolling of stats added by Samson 2-8-98. Code courtesy of Kermit's Mud Page */

        write_to_buffer( d, "You may now roll for your character's stats.\r\nYou may roll as often as you like.\r\n",0);
        
	  name_stamp_stats(ch);

        snprintf( buf, MAX_STRING_LENGTH, "\r\nStr: %d  Int: %d  Wis: %d  Dex: %d  Con: %d  Cha: %d  Lck: %d\r\nKeep? (Y/N)",
        ch->perm_str, ch->perm_int, ch->perm_wis, ch->perm_dex, ch->perm_con, 
	  ch->perm_cha, ch->perm_lck );
        write_to_buffer( d, buf, 0 );

        d->connected = CON_ROLL_STATS;
        break;

     Find the following code segment:

		/* ch->resist           += race_table[ch->race]->resist;    drats */
            /* ch->susceptible     += race_table[ch->race]->suscept;    drats */

	    name_stamp_stats( ch );

     Comment out the call to name_stamp_stats here.

   Find function close_socket and locate the following lines of code:

	if ( dclose->connected == CON_PLAYING
	||   dclose->connected == CON_EDITING )
	{
	    act( AT_ACTION, "$n has lost $s link.", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_CANSEE );
	    ch->desc = NULL;
	}

   Change those lines to read:

	if ( dclose->connected == CON_PLAYING
	||   dclose->connected == CON_EDITING
	||   dclose->connected == CON_ROLL_STATS )
	{
	    act( AT_ACTION, "$n has lost $s link.", ch, NULL, NULL, TO_CANSEE );
	    ch->desc = NULL;
	}

   Find function check_playing, and locate the following lines of code:

	    if ( !ch->name
	    || ( cstate != CON_PLAYING && cstate != CON_EDITING ))
	    {
		write_to_buffer( d, "Already connected - try again.\r\n", 0 );
		sprintf( log_buf, "%s already connected.", 
				ch->pcdata->filename );
		log_string_plus( log_buf, LOG_COMM, sysdata.log_level );
		return BERR;
	    }

   Change those lines to read:

	    if ( !ch->name
	    || ( cstate != CON_PLAYING && cstate != CON_EDITING && cstate != CON_ROLL_STATS ))
	    {
                char lbuf[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];

		write_to_buffer( d, "Already connected - try again.\r\n", 0 );
		snprintf( lbuf, MAX_STRING_LENGTH, "%s already connected.", ch->pcdata->filename );
		log_string_plus( lbuf, LOG_COMM, sysdata.log_level );
		return BERR;
	    }

3. In handler.c, find name_stamp_stats. Comment it out, 
    and replace it with the following:

/*
 * "Roll" players stats based on the character name		-Thoric
 */
/* Rewritten by Whir. Thanks to Vor/Casteele for help 2-1-98 */
/* Racial bonus calculations moved to this function and removed
   from comm.c - Samson 2-2-98 */
/* Updated to AD&D standards by Samson 9-5-98 */
/* Changed to use internal random number generator instead of
   OS dependant random() function - Samson 9-5-98 */

void name_stamp_stats( CHAR_DATA *ch )
{
     ch->perm_str = 6 + dice( 2,6 );
     ch->perm_dex = 6 + dice( 2,6 );
     ch->perm_wis = 6 + dice( 2,6 );
     ch->perm_int = 6 + dice( 2,6 );
     ch->perm_con = 6 + dice( 2,6 );
     ch->perm_cha = 6 + dice( 2,6 );
     ch->perm_lck = 6 + dice( 2,6 );
     
     ch->perm_str	+= race_table[ch->race]->str_plus;
     ch->perm_int	+= race_table[ch->race]->int_plus;
     ch->perm_wis	+= race_table[ch->race]->wis_plus;
     ch->perm_dex	+= race_table[ch->race]->dex_plus;
     ch->perm_con	+= race_table[ch->race]->con_plus;
     ch->perm_cha	+= race_table[ch->race]->cha_plus; 
     ch->perm_lck	+= race_table[ch->race]->lck_plus;
}

4. In mud_comm.c, function do_mpapplyb,
   do yourself a favor and remove the following chunk of code:

/* Stat stuff that follows from here to name_stamp is to keep stat-cheats
   from abusing the auth system -- Blodkai */
        victim->perm_str                = 13;
        victim->perm_dex                = 13;
        victim->perm_int                = 13;
        victim->perm_wis                = 13;
        victim->perm_cha                = 13;
        victim->perm_con                = 13;
        victim->perm_lck                = 13;
        switch ( class_table[victim->class]->attr_prime )
        {
          case APPLY_STR: victim->perm_str = 16; break;
          case APPLY_INT: victim->perm_int = 16; break;
          case APPLY_WIS: victim->perm_wis = 16; break;
          case APPLY_DEX: victim->perm_dex = 16; break;
          case APPLY_CON: victim->perm_con = 16; break;
          case APPLY_CHA: victim->perm_cha = 16; break;
          case APPLY_LCK: victim->perm_lck = 16; break;
        }
        victim->perm_str         += race_table[victim->race]->str_plus;
        victim->perm_int         += race_table[victim->race]->int_plus;
        victim->perm_wis         += race_table[victim->race]->wis_plus;
        victim->perm_dex         += race_table[victim->race]->dex_plus;
        victim->perm_con         += race_table[victim->race]->con_plus;
        victim->perm_cha         += race_table[victim->race]->cha_plus;
        victim->perm_lck         += race_table[victim->race]->lck_plus;
	name_stamp_stats( victim ); /* Take care of auth cons -- Blodkai */

   
5. In mud.h, add CON_ROLL_STATS to the list of connected states.

6. Make clean, and recompile.
