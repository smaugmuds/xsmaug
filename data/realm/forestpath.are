smell is not good, and their appearance is worse.  All are stained

ExDescKey    table cards dice~
ExDesc       The tables are fairly primitive wood construction, maybe the kind
that a peasant would use.  They are all fairly stained with pools
and residue of various types of spilled alcohol.  The cards
and dice are of a poor quality and some of the cards sport
rather large stains making gaming against those who know
the splotches on the back of the cards inadvisable.
The dice look as they are made from somethings bone.

ExDesc       The target is a large fairly circular tree cross-section.  With
prominent bands in its ring variation.  Apparently these are use for
scoring the game.  The whole front of the target is a mass of wood
pulp from being repeatedly hit by knives and daggers.

Okay here is my second area.   This Area represents more of a
'realistic fantasy' rather than an 'epic fantasy' setting.

This area is a path to go from one area to another, but is a
bit too dangerous to probably be considered a linkage area.

Note that some of the mobs have Rand_progs for them attacking
rather than being outright aggressive, both to suprise
experienced players and give newbies more a chance to
determine combat.

ExDescKey    plot plots~
ExDesc       This represents an old trade route, made unusable by the
Bandit Eric and his group.

Along the main path the players meet the Knight Theggory.
He tells of seeking a druid. 
The Druid tells of needing to help the forest as it isn't as
healthy as it seems, so he seeks the guardian of the forest a
dryad.
The Dryad says that she has been driven from her tree by
humans, she needs the Heart of the Tree to regain her home.
The Tree is the base Erics Band and entry is hard to find
without talking to the Dryad, deep in the tree is the 
heart for which the dryad will reward the return of.
