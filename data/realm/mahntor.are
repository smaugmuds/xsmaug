Desc      You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.

Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.
